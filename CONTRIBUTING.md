## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Git
- Virtual environment tools

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/dasmrpmunna/ai-skin-disease-classification.git
cd ai-skin-disease-classification

# Set up backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## 📋 Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

```python
def preprocess_image(image: Image.Image, target_size: tuple) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Preprocess image for model prediction.
    
    Args:
        image: PIL Image object
        target_size: Target dimensions (width, height)
    
    Returns:
        Preprocessed image array
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Follow ESLint and Prettier rules
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful component and variable names

```typescript
interface PredictionResult {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  predictedClass: string;
  confidence: number;
}

const PredictionComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ data }) => {
  // Implementation here
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- Minimum 80% code coverage
